When i start mining with nicehasher my display driver freezes the system.
It is a Powercolor RX480 8GB and a I5 with ASUS Z97 Pro Gamer Mainboard and Windows 10 Pro 64bit.
I installed the newest drivers (mainboard chipset and amd rx480).
I ran cpu and video stress tests and memory diagnostics...no problems.
Mainboard BIOS and operating system is up to date...
I tried different nicehasher settings (temperature control, default optimizations...)
Any ideas ?

Christian
